1. Write a C program, in which you have an array of integers and size of array is 10.
Read 8 numbers (enter using keyboard) onto the array and print the same onto screen

2. Write a C program in which you have an integer array of size 10, read 8 numbers into
it. Print the sum of all the numbers in the array.

3. Write a C program in which you have an integer array of size 6. Read 4 numbers
into it and reverse the array.
For Ex:
if initially array elements were 10 100 20 1
After reversing it should be 1 20 100 10.
NOTE: Its not printing in reverse order !!!. Actual elements should change their
position. In the above example, in the original array, index 0 had 10. After
re arranging it should have 1 at index 0.
