The cat sat on the mat.
The dog chased the ball.
The bird flew in the sky.
The sun shone brightly.
The moon shone dimly.
The stars twinkled in the night sky.
The wind blew through the trees.
The rain fell from the sky.
The river flowed through the valley.
The mountain stood tall.
The forest was green and lush.
