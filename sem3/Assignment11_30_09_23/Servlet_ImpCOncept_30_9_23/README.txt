Follow this Order to analyse the requirements:

1. OPen HtmlForm_1.png
This is a normal html form, supposed to be in the ROOT folder. 
You need to enter Name and age as shown and SUBMIT the same.
This input would be processed by a Servlet.

2. Open EnteredName2_andSubmitted.png
This is how the output of Servlet looks like. But whats more imp
is that it has created another form which is asking you to enter
Name2. But most importantly , below that, Name and Age are automatically
filled. Now just enter Name2 and submit. All the inputs go to another
Servlet. Since this form is built by Servlet and displayed as part of
result page, no need to search for this form in ROOT folder !!! (Understood???)

3. Open FinalResult_DisplayedByAnotherServlet.png
This is how final result is displayed by second Servlet.
