1. Write a Servlet in which you take input about Database name, Table name and Values to be stored in the table.
For now, create only one database, with a single table. Let the table contain id and name as content. Store 3 sets
of values in it. Use JDBC code as part of doGet() method of servlet and implement this.


2. Improvise by having a separate method that does JDBC work and call this method from doGet() method of
servlet. Note down any challenges you face.


3. Design an html form, that takes name and age of a person. Now, write a servlet that takes this input and displays
both the name and age. The same servlet, will also display another form, along with this result. This form is created
by Servlet (BAsically the result display page will also have provision to enter some more data). Using this form, enter
another name. When submitted , another servlet takes this input along with the name and age submitted from first
form (this is the catch!!!0 and displays concatenated name along with age. 
Note: Whatever you know about string, string manipulation and servlet till today, is more than enough to achieve this.
Have attached some screenshots that tells you the expected output.
In the zip file, first go through README.txt and follow instructions as per that.
