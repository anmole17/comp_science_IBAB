1. You will create a simple HTML FORM and store the same in ROOT folder as .html file.
When rendered it looks like the one shown in First_HTML_Form.png
Value of the submit button could be anything you think valid.

2. When you click on the submit button of the above form, a Servlet will create another form 
and the display would be as shown in SecondForm_GenFrmServlet.png .
IMPORTANT Manadates to be implemented in this Servlet : 
A Loop is a must. 
The value of the submit button can be anything you feel valid.
Suppose at a later stage, more numbers have to be taken as input, it should be possible with a small
subtle change to the loop.

3. When the above form is duly filled, it looks like SecondForm_DulyFilled.png 
When this form is submitted, another servlet takes the input and processes the same.

4. The results shown by the final servlet would be as shown in FinalServletOutput.png
Mandates to be followed as part of this final servlet are:
a. An array should be used.
b Looping should be used.


IMPORTANT NOTE: ONCE YOU ARE SUCCESSFULLY DONE WITH THIS ASSIGNMENT, CHANGE BOTH THE SERVLETS TO jsp CODE
AND TEST THE SAME AS WELL.
