1. Write a Program in C++ that does the following:
- Contain 4 classes, namely master, squr, avg , ordr.
- master class in a way plays the role of a master or controller.
- First, a method in master will take an integer number input from the user.
- This number is sent to the class squr by master.
- squr will use one of its methods to calculate “square” of the number and returns
the result to master.
- master will then send this result from squr, along with 2 more integer numbers to
the “avg” class.
- avg class will take these 3 numbers, calculates the average and returns the same to
master.
- Now master will take the result of avg, and along with the same will send another 5
integer numbers to ordr class.
- ordr class will take all the numbers, calculates largest and smallest of these numbers,
and sends back the same to master.
- master also displays the result(s) of avg, squr and ordr.
NOTE: Use any number of methods in any of the classes. Use any technique to return
Values from any method(s). Make sure mandates not compromised.
2. Write a Program in C to implement a doubly linked list with the following features/clauses:
- DLL contains 16 nodes, each with an integer value as data
- insertion and deletion of nodes should be allowed with the following protocol
- any insertion can happen only at position 4 or position 8.
For every data that needs to be inserted, user should also input its position (4 or 8)
- After every insertion operation, the whole DLL should be displayed.
- Deletion of node can happen only at position 3. This means, once the deletion
option is selected by the user, the node at position 3 should be the one deleted.
- After every deletion operation entire DLL should be displayed.
3. Write a program in java that showcases:
- String Pool
- Abstract class
- Wrapper class “Integer”
- Working of Constructor
A single program should show all the above features. The output should convince us of the
working of these concepts.
