1. Each rectangle is a node. Make sure you implement this model with
atleast 16 intermediate nodes apart from start and end nodes. These
16 are 8 nodes running in parallel as shown in the diagram . Through traversal
you should prove that there are two parallel paths from start to end.
Let each node contain some integer number.
Direction of traversal is in "forward" direction only. Refer to pdf for the architecture of the list.
