1. Write a CPP program in which you have 2 classes, namely Add and Diff.
Add has a method named void adding() and Diff has a method named void difference().
adding() will ask user to enter 2 integer values and finds the sum of the same and prints result.
difference() will ask user to enter 2 integer values and finds the difference and prints the same.
Derive Diff class from Add class. Create object of DIff and invoke both adding() and difference() 
methods.

2. Implement(1) in java.
3. Improvise(1) by taking inputs in main() and passing the same to adding() and difference().

4. Implement (3) in Java
