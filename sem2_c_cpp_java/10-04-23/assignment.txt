1. Write a program in CPP, to calculate square root and cube root of a number. Use the library methods
sqrt(number), cbrt(number) which will return the square root and cube root respectively. Include cmath
header before using libraries. 

2. Work on (1) without using libraries.

3. Try (1) in Java . To do this, first import java.lang.Math. (might work without importing too..but better import.)
Then use Math.sqrt(number) and Math.cbrt(number) to calculate square root and cube root respectively.

4. Create a java library, which has a class with 4 methods to calculate square,cube,square root and cube root. No built in libraries should be used to achieve these .
