1. Write a CPP program that calculates mean, median, mode and range of 'n' numbers. The entire program should consist at least one abstract class and two derived classes. 

2. Write a program in java that showcases multi level inheritance.

3. Write a program in C to implement DLL with 8 nodes. Each node has an integer value. Traverse in both directions and print the value at each node.

4.Write a program in C that creates two DLLs each of 8 nodes . Then concatenate both, traverse through the new DLL and print value at each node.

5. Create a DLL with 10 nodes. Each node has integer value. User will enter a number to be searched and the program will print Found if the number is present.

6. Create a DLL that has 10 nodes . Each node a integer value. The protocol for traversal is this.
Traverse two nodes in forward direction , followed by one node in backward direction. Keep printing the values at each node.
Ex: if the values at each node are
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
Then traversing prints
1 2 3 2 3 4 3 4 5 4 5 6 5 and so on
