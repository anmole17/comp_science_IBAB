Discussed in Theory class:
1. Write a program in Java to reverse the content of a file(character wise).
2. Improvise (1) to concatenate 2 files. The Output should contain text from 1st file as 
    it is but concent of 2nd file is reversed. 
3. Extra:  Try to improvise copying one file to another such that you can type "CPY 1.txt 2.txt" on terminal to 
    copy one file to another in java without using java keyword to run.
