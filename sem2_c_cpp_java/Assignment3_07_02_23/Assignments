1. Write a program, in which you have a linked list of 5 nodes. Give an option to print any node value (every node has one  int value). Go to that specific node (traverse) and print that specific int value.

2. Have two linked lists of 3 nodes each. Every node has one int value.
Print both the linked lists. Now concat the lists (add second to end of first), creating a new Linked list with 6 nodes. Traverse this new list and print the value at each node.

3. Have a linked list of 10 nodes. Each node has an int value. Search for a value in the linked list and print "Present" if you find it. This value to be searched, is entered by the user.
