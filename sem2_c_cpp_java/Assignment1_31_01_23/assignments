Assignments:
1. Write a CPP program, where you have 2 data items (both int) and one method in a class.
Do not give any access specifier for both data and method. Now write main() and create
an object and try to initialise the data directly and also try to invoke the method directly.
Analyse this and note down findings.

2. Write a CPP program, where you have 2 data items (int, float) and use public access
specifier for data. Now under same public specifier, write a method f1() that initialises
the variables and prints the same. In main(), create the object and do direct initialisation
of data again and also invoke the method. Note down the observations.

3. Write a CPP program, where you have 3 data items (int, float, char) and use private access
specifier for data. Then use public access specifier and define 2 methods f1() and f2().
f1() initialised int,float vals and adds them and prints the result. f2() initialises the character
value and prints the same. Now create object and invoke f1() and f2(). Note down the 
observations.
