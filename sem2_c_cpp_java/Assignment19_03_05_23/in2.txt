The training will be tough, but I am sure great adventurer that you will become strong.
The fate of Wesnoth in in your hand!
Your brother has already finished the training 
and gone to fight the goblins in the forest ahead.
The Orc army is marching towards the village and will pass the forest in a week. 
Together with you and your brother on our side we can defend our village until 
reinforcement from the kingdom comes.
