1. Write a program in C, to create a SLL with 18 nodes. Let each node contain one data item that is an integer.
Allow deletion of nodes using the following protocol:
                 - Should allow deletion of odd numbered nodes only twice.
                 - The program should exit once only two nodes are left in the list.


2.  Write a program in C, to create a SLL with 8 nodes. Let each node contain one data item which is an integer.
Traverse through the list and print the values at each node. Now select 2 nodes (input by user), validate the same,
then interchange the values of the nodes, and then do another traversal that should validate the change of
values.

3. Improvise (2) where in you will interchange the nodes themselves.
