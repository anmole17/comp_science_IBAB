1. Write a program in CPP that contains 4 unrelated classes.
Lets call them as A,B,C and D.
D will have a method named "srch" standing for "search". When you run it, it asks the user, to enter any
integer number. Now, it searches if this number is part of D and also if its part of A,B,C. If the number is
found as part of A / B /C /D, it will print that the number is present and also the Class in which its present.
It can be present in only one Class or in All classes. It may not be present also in any class, in which case
the method will print "Not Found". 
NOTE: This is a sort of open ended Q. Lots of decision making needs to be done. This is where your 
prowess should help you. I would appreciate if each one of you work in your own individual way and achieve
the results. Note down all your assumptions and decision making points. 

2. Write a program in Java that does the following:
                - It has 3 classes namely A, B , and C.
                - An object of class C, will take a "String" as input from user and passes the same to an object of A and B
                - A's object will take the string , reverses it and somehow sends this reversed string to object of B.
                - B's object will take the string from A , concatenates it will the one received from C, and displays the result.
Note: In this Question too, you need to take a call about Class relationship , parameter passing etc. Make sure you
are clear with the design and note down all the points that are assumed and or decided upon.
